Termux is a free and open source Android terminal emulator that allows you to run a Linux environment on your phone. Additionally, the application's package manager can be used to install a variety of apps.

Termux automatically installs a simple base system, and additional packages can be found via a package manager.

Most Linux commands, as well as built-in Bash commands, are available. Several alternative shells, such as Zsh and tcsh, are also available.

Termux is the first Android terminal emulator to contain a wide range of software, unlike other terminal emulators that only offer a few small or limited Android utilities.
