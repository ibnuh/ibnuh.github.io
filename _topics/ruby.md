Ruby is a high-level, interpreted programming language that supports a variety of programming paradigms. It was created with a focus on programming productivity and ease of use. Everything, including primitive data types, is an object in Ruby. Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto created it in Japan in the mid-1990s.

Ruby uses garbage collection and just-in-time compilation and is dynamically typed. Procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming are among the programming paradigms supported. Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, BASIC, and Lisp, according to its author.
