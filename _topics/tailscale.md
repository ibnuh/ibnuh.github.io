Tailscale Inc., situated in Toronto, Canada, is a software company with a freemium business strategy. Tailscale offers an open-source mesh virtual private network (VPN) software and a web-based management solution based on Software-Defined Networking (SDN). Under the same name, the company offers a zero-configuration networking|zero config mesh VPN solution.

In November 2020, the company received $12 million in a Series A round of funding. Accel (company)|Accel is leading the investment, which also includes Heavybit and Uncork Capital.

Using the Wireguard protocol, the open-source software works in tandem with the management service to establish peer-to-peer or relayed VPN communication with other customers. If the software is unable to establish direct communication, it falls back on the company's relays. Clients are assigned IPv4 addresses from the Carrier-grade NAT allocated space. To minimize interfering with existing networks, this option was chosen. On some clients, the setup also permits traffic to be routed to networks behind the client.
