ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Ibnuh, and I work as a software engineer on a regular basis. I admire clear and easy-to-maintain code as someone who specializes in backend programming. I've worked on a number of businesses, remotely developing applications alongside other teams from across the world. I'm a good learner who strives to follow to the best practices and has written well-documented software.

I uses an alias on the internet because my real name is quite long, which is **M. Ibnu Luthfi Azhar**.

I enjoy watching movies, traveling, and eating delicious food. This blog is where I will try to communicate my thoughts, because I have no idea how to write.
