Iâ€™m from Indonesia, currently working as a full-time web developer on a Singapore-based company. I don't have important things to do except sitting in front of my laptop. I like to watch movies, travels, and eat delicious food though if that the things you want to know.

This journal is where I share my thoughts, at least I'll try because I have no idea how to write.
