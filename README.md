My personal Jekyll theme for my blog. It's a clean, responsive theme that I've customized to my preferences.

This theme started as a fork of [Tale](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale) by Chester How, but I've customized it to match my preferences and needs:

- Modern color schemes and typography
- Improved mobile responsiveness
- Enhanced code block styling
- Better hover effects and animations
- Updated layout and spacing
- Custom catalogue styling
- And many other personal touches

## Features

- Clean and minimal design
- Responsive layout
- Syntax highlighting
- Mobile-first approach
- SEO optimized
- Fast loading
- Easy to customize
