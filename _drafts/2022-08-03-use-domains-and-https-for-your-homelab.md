In my previous post [Easily build your own network with Tailscale](/easily-build-your-own-network-with-tailscale), I described how you can connect your devices to a free and easy to setup VPN called [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com), it allows you to have an always on [split-tunnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_tunneling) connection and have access to your devices from the allocated tailscale private IP address.
