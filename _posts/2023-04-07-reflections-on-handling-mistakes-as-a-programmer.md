One thing I appreciate about being a web developer is that most of our mistakes are fixable. Messed something up? Hit undo, revert the commit, push again. Sure, there are consequences - wasted time, angry clients, maybe some data loss - but most of the time you can recover from it.

Compare that to doctors, engineers, or pilots - if they mess up, people can actually die. That doesn't make our job less important, but the stakes are definitely different.

That said, knowing you can always revert stuff can make you sloppy if you're not careful. I've caught myself skipping things because "I can just fix it later" and that's a bad habit. The safety net is nice, but it shouldn't be an excuse to cut corners.

I try to look back at my past screw-ups every now and then. Not to beat myself up, but because that's honestly where I learn the most. And let's be real, reverting a broken deploy at 2am is not fun - better to get it right the first time when you can.
