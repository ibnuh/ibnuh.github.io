_No more dragging or guessing—center any window perfectly, even across multiple monitors._

As someone who's constantly alt-tabbing between code editors, browser tabs, and terminal windows, I've lost hours dragging windows to the approximate center of my screen. Windows' built-in snapping? Clunky. Third-party tools? Bloatware. Let's fix this with **8 lines of AutoHotkey magic** that works flawlessly on multi-monitor setups.

### Before you ask

Yes, this handles ultrawide monitors. Yes, it respects taskbar positioning. No, it won't break when you unplug your laptop from a dock.

### The Script

Features:

-   Hotkey: `Win + C` → instant centering
-   Detects which monitor your window is on automatically
-   Matches your taskbar's reserved space (no overlap!)
-   Tested on Windows 10/11 with AutoHotkey v2

```javascript
; Center active window
#c::  {
    WinGetPos(&X, &Y, &W, &H, "A")
    CoordMode("Mouse", "Screen")
    MouseGetPos(&mouseX, &mouseY)
    monitorNumber := MonitorGetPrimary()

    ; Find which monitor the window is actually on
    Loop MonitorGetCount() {
        MonitorGetWorkArea(A_Index, &mLeft, &mTop, &mRight, &mBottom)
        if (X >= mLeft && X < mRight && Y >= mTop && Y < mBottom) {
            monitorNumber := A_Index
            break
        }
    }

    ; Calculate perfect center for THAT monitor
    MonitorGetWorkArea(monitorNumber, &monitorLeft, &monitorTop, &monitorRight, &monitorBottom)
    newX := monitorLeft + (monitorRight - monitorLeft - W) / 2
    newY := monitorTop + (monitorBottom - monitorTop - H) / 2
    WinMove newX, newY,,, "A"
}
```

### How to Set It Up

1. **Install AutoHotkey v2+** ([Download here](https://www.autohotkey.com/)).
2. **Save the script** as `WindowCenteringWizard.ahk`.
3. **Right-click → Run Script**. (Want it always available? [Add to startup](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/FAQ.htm#Startup)).

### Customize The Script

-   **Change the hotkey**: Replace `#c` with:

    -   `^!c` for `Ctrl + Alt + C`
    -   `#!Down` for `Win + Alt + Down Arrow`

    See more details on [How to Write Hotkeys](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/howto/WriteHotkeys.htm)

-   **Add animation**: [See this tweak](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/lib/WinMove.htm#Remarks) for smooth transitions.

### Gotchas

-   **Admin windows** (Task Manager, Command Prompt, PowerShell)

    Run the AHK script as Administrator to control them.

-   **Game overlays**

    Some fullscreen games ignore window moves.

-   **Ultrawide monitor users**

    For horizontal bias, tweak `newX` calculation:

    ```javascript
    newX := monitorLeft + (monitorRight - monitorLeft - W) / 3  ; 1/3 from left
    ```

### Explanation: How It Works

_Or: "Why you shouldn't just copy-paste code blindly"_

This script isn't malware, but **blindly running code you don't understand is how you end up debugging a 3 AM disaster**. Let's break it down so you're not left guessing

**1. The Mouse Trick (That Isn't Pointless)**

```javascript
CoordMode("Mouse", "Screen")
MouseGetPos(&mouseX, &mouseY)
```

_Why?_ AutoHotkey sometimes struggles with windows spanning monitors. Grabbing the mouse position acts like a “hint” to avoid centering your Notepad window on the wrong screen.

**2. The Monitor Detective Work**

```javascript
Loop MonitorGetCount() {
    MonitorGetWorkArea(A_Index, &mLeft, &mTop, &mRight, &mBottom)
    if (X >= mLeft && X < mRight && Y >= mTop && Y < mBottom) {
        monitorNumber := A_Index
        break
    }
}
```

_Translation:_ It hunts down which monitor your window is actually on by checking coordinates against all connected displays. No more “why's my window halfway offscreen?!” moments.

**3. Math That (Actually) Makes Sense**

```javascript
newX := monitorLeft + (monitorRight - monitorLeft - W) / 2
newY := monitorTop + (monitorBottom - monitorTop - H) / 2
```

Some algebra that I actually can understand—it's calculating the exact center of your monitor's **usable area** (subtracting taskbars/docks).

### Conclusion

This script has lived in my system tray for almost a year—no crashes, no conflicts. Next time you're arranging windows, hit Win + C and reclaim your sanity.
